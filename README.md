# NeetCode 150 Roadmap 🚀

## Overview
Welcome to my NeetCode 150 Roadmap repository! This journey is aimed at my improving problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews.

## Why NeetCode 150?
The **NeetCode 150** consists of the most commonly asked problems in coding interviews. Completing these problems helps in:
- Strengthening **fundamental** data structures & algorithms knowledge.
- Gaining familiarity with common **patterns** in coding challenges.
- Enhancing problem-solving speed and efficiency.
- Building confidence for **technical interviews** at top tech companies.

## Roadmap 🛤️
I'll be following a structured approach by categorizing problems into major topics:

### 📌 Data Structures:
- [ ] Arrays & Hashing
- [ ] Two Pointers
- [ ] Sliding Window
- [ ] Stacks & Queues
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Trees & Graphs

### 🔢 Algorithms:
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Recursion & Backtracking
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Bit Manipulation

## Progress Tracking 📊
I'll update this repository regularly with:
- 📝 **Solutions** to each problem (Python initially but Java and C++ in the future)
- 📌 **Approach & Explanation** for each solution
- ⏳ **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**
